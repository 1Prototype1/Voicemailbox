# Voicemailbox
An offline voicemail service that answers incoming call automatically if not answered by the user, tells caller to leave a message,records it and then notifies the user when the screen is unlocked.

**Basic Idea:**  
- Answer call after timeout.
- Play recorded message.
- Record voicecall.
    
**Approach:** 
  I am first going to try this on Tasker and then try to create a standalone app.
            
**Progress:**  


```diff
+ Answer Call
+ Greetings mp3[Customized][Thanks to Julie]
+ Play mp3 through speaker
+ Mute microphone
+ Record Call
- Notify user when screen unlocked
- Create a standalone app or installer
```
Above steps are working **without Root**  which is great!:wink:<br>
**Testing Device:**
Redmi 4x Android Oreo 8.1 [SDK 27]
