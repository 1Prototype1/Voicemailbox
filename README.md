# Voicemailbox
An offline voicemail service that answers incoming call automatically if not answered by the user, tells caller to leave a message,records it and then notifies the user when the screen is unlocked.

<b>Basic Idea:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Answer call after timeout.
  <li>Play recorded message.
  <li>Record voicecall.
  </ul> <br> 
<b>Approach:</b><br>
  I am first going to try this on Tasker and then try to create a standalone app.
  <br><br><br>
  <b>Progress:</b><br>


```diff
+ Answer Call
+ Greetings mp3
- Play mp3 silently(Speaker ATM)
- Record Call
```
